					  <p>OK, so it’s dreaded tax time again... but don’t panic! We’ve got some expert tips. And remember, if it’s all getting too hard... time to make an appointment with Tax Defence!</p>
					  <h1>Our  top tax tips</h1>
		            <h3>1. Be Organised.</h3>
				    <p>Remember to ask for a tax receipt if you pay for something that may be claimable.<br />
				    Your paperwork needs to be safely stored for generally 5 years. If you lose a tax deductible receipt, you may lose the ability to claim it!</p>
					  <p>Don’t use highlighters, or leave receipts in the heat or next to plastic wallets, as it will cause them to fade. If you are technically minded it is acceptable for you to scan receipts or use a service like Shoeboxed.</p>
					  <p>Typically each year you require the same sort of information. For easy reference keep each financial year paperwork in its’ own file.</p>
				    <p>Use dividers to separate and identify; general tax information, bank statements, investment accounts, declarable income, shares, superannuation information, claimable receipts, government payments.</p>
					  <h3>2. Record your records.</h3>
					  <p>Use an excel spreadsheet to record your income and expenses during the year. <br />
					    It is worth cross-checking that the pre-filled information is correct - that is, that your financial information has been properly linked to your tax file number.</p>
			        <h3>3. Here I am!</h3>
				    <p>Make sure you receive your income statements (previously known as group certificates or payment summaries) from all employees in this financial year; they should be issued by 14th July.</p>
				    <h3>4. Stay Informed.</h3>
					  <p>Understand what work related expenses you can claim, and those that are unique to your industry; airline stewards are allowed to claim stockings, hairdressers can claim protective aprons and gloves, while teachers can claim suntan cream.<br />
				    If your claims exceed $300 you must have written evidence to substantiate your claims.</p>
			        <h3>5. Review your Rebates.</h3>
					  <p>Tax rebates, such as the private health insurance rebate, reduces the tax you owe and may be offered as an incentive, as a credit for tax already paid, or to relieve personal circumstances.</p>
					  <h3>6. Be Kind.</h3>
				    <p>Donations over $2 in value are tax deductible; just remember to keep those receipts!</p>
				    <h3>7. Phone a Friend.</h3>
				    <p>If you are unsure, you can ring the ATO on the personal tax line 13 28 61.</p>
					  <h3>8. The Lodge.</h3>
					  <p>Save money and submit your own income tax return with Tax Defence by the 31st of October.</p>
